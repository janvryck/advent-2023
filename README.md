## Set-up

Initial set-up, including:

* `days.Day`,
* `util.InputReader`,
* `Runner` and
* Gradle setup

were adapted from [aoc-kotlin-starter](https://github.com/hughjdavey/aoc-kotlin-starter) in 2021.

### Running

Run with Gradle, either

* running all `Days`:   
  `./gradlew run`
* or a specific `Day`:  
  `./gradlew run --args <day>`

#### Tests

Run tests through the IDE or run with Gradle, either

* running all tests:  
  `./gradlew test`
* or a specific test:  
  `./gradlew test --tests <testClassName>`
